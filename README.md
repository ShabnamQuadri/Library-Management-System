# üìö Library Management System (SQL Project)

## üìå Project Overview
This is a beginner-friendly **SQL database project** that simulates a simple **Library Management System**.  
It was built using **Oracle SQL** in an online compiler (Oracle LiveSQL), and covers the basics of creating tables, inserting data, and writing SQL queries.

The project stores information about:
- Books available in the library
- Members registered in the library
- Loans (which member borrowed which book)

## üéØ Features
- Create and manage **Books**, **Members**, and **Loans** tables
- Add new records using `INSERT` statements
- Fetch data using `SELECT` queries with `JOIN`
- Check for **overdue books**
- Update stock when a book is borrowed
- Mark books as returned
